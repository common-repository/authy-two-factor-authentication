Authy is the easiest and fastest way to add strong 2 Factor Authentication to your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

Authy helps you increase security for your user accounts in your WordPress site by using strong Two-Factor authentication. The plugin can be installed and configured in a matter of minutes.

Two-Factor Authentication protects you from password re-use, phishing and keylogger attacks. The Authy WordPress plugin was designed so that anyone can install it, configure it and use it. Security shouldn't be painful!

**NOTICE**

If you are running an older version of the WordPress plugin (i.e. 2.5.5 and below) and you are running a version of Wordpress 4.5 and above, please upgrade your Authy plugin to 3.0 and above to remediate a problem where 2FA can be bypassed in certain circumstances.

= How it Works =

Usually you use only a username and a password to login to your blog. If your password is stolen or guessed, someone else can now login to your blog. Therefore with two-factor authentication, you use an additional step to login and one that uses something you have in your possession that is harder to steal.

Authy uses your phone number as the extra piece of security and there are a few ways it is used.

1. Get a security token via SMS or a phone call. This code is then used to login with your username and password.
2. Generate the same token using Authy, our mobile application.
3. Get a push notification via Authy, out mobile application. This is a lot more secure and easier way to login.
